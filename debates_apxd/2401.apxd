text(16440, Doesn't have to be. Verbosity has nothing to do with static typing or not (See witty one-liners in FP languages). The same bloat also exists in dynamic languages. Eg. Facebook and php. It's an expression of bad design and not of language. Static typing doesn't promote that kind of bad design per se.).

arg(17013).
text(17013, Static typification is very often leading to better maintainable codebases: Before you start coding you need an exessive design phase and architecture blueprinting. It is less done so in dynamic pl. Thats why they are good for quick prototyping. You already have a hardtime renaming a variable though).
support(17013, 16099).

arg(16426).
text(16426, Static typing leads to large codebases with more files and classes compared to dynamically typed languages. It also forces the continual creation of logic which has nothing to do with the actual problem being solved. And which have to be maintained too.).

arg(16523).
text(16523, Every error can be made a type error in a sufficiently expressive type system, with the extreme case being dependent types, which can encode everything.

In practice, though, I think that type systems that support tagged unions / variant types catch many bugs with little effort.).

text(16449, There are other things that can be done with the type checking alone. Like SKI calculus in scala.

arg(16444).
text(16444, Dynamic typed systems need to place guards in hot spot optimizations to ensure that the optimization is running over the correct structure.

arg(16441).
text(16441, The types need to be correct anyway. So the worry surfaces at runtime or during testing. Debugging because of hidden type errors is mostly more time consuming than correcting compiler errors immediately.

arg(16431).
text(16431, I would say it is not the case at all. The logic/yak shaving ratio is much lower for dynamically typed languages. Properly name-spaced and unit-tested, they should be easier or much easier to maintain. Also - refactoring is much simpler in dynamic languages.).
