text(16650, Religion can only be used to legitimize an already existing condition, and in that case, much of the religion is ignored and some aspects are given importance, in order to legitimize the fascist state that Daesh is. So the problem is not ideology or religion but what fueled them, what gave them life).

text(16534, Agreed. While I personally view religion to be at times destructive on an individual level because it grants privilege to antiquated assumptions over historical and scientific facts, what makes it fascist is the fact that power is owned by 1 ideological group that views itself as superior to others.).
