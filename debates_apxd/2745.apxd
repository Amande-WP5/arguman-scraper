arg(19373).
text(19373, Arguman allows us to use only simple logic in any argument map, using independent premises.

It does not allow us to use the following sophisticated arguments:
1 Co-premises.
2 Intermediate conclusions (sub-conclusions)

Most long-winded premises are actually a bundle of such sub-conclusions.).
