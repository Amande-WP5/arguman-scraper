arg(13088).
text(13088, It is impossible to prove a hypothesis correct. It is only possible to prove it is incorrect. A hypothesis gains credibility by giving repeated predictions that are correct within some error range. Every scientific theory we have could still be wrong and replaced by a more accurate theory.).

arg(12702).
text(12702, The scientific method cannot guarantee it holding true. For example, we believe the physical laws of the universe are constant because the scientific method has proved it so. But that does not mean that they cannot change, however unlikely. What guarantees are made we are not living in the Matrix?).

arg(13227).
text(13227, A hypothesis being "proven true" is not the goal of the scientific method; the scientific method helps us to find out whether or not a hypothesis approximates the truth closely enough for us to make decisions based on it.

arg(13528).
text(13528, Every scientific hypothesis can be disproved by a single counter example. There are an infinite number of counter examples to test. Since we cannot test an infinite number of examples a scientific hypothesis can never be proved.).

arg(13579).
text(13579, Having enough evidence for a hypothesis to make it extremely unlikely for it to be false is defined as „being proven“ in science. However, scientific hypotheses cannot be proven in the sense of a mathematical proof.).

arg(13099).
text(13099, Just because some law of universe can change doesn't mean at all that scientific hypothesis can't be proven. And until now, there wasn't any change in in those, and there isnt any theory that disprove the scientific method.).

I think there was a misunderstanding, maybe you misread something. (i will make a small edit to be more clear)).

arg(12779).
text(12779, We need induction and deduction to prove scientific hypotheses.
But we only prove by deduction, not by induction, then we can’t prove scientific hypotheses.

arg(13107).
text(13107, Scientifically relevant sure, but in the realm of epistemology, which is the foundation on which science is built, induction is invalid.

att(13107, root).

arg(13108).
text(13108, The point of a scientific hypothesis is not to be proven, but to be disproven. Scientific hypotheses must be falsifiable. It is only when we find that we cannot disprove the hypothesis, despite our best attempts, that we begin to accept it as truth. ).

arg(13110).
text(13110, additionally, the entire debate is about IF science can PROVE anything. Saying something is good science says nothing about weather or not good science PROVES something. Induction, cannot make any certain claim about anything because of the problem of induction.).

arg(14200).
text(14200, Because the scientific method doesn't rely wholly on deductive reasoning. For example just because every time I throw a rock it lands, doesn't prove that every time I throw a rock it will land (in fact with sufficient velocity it would never land) this extrapolation is termed induction.).

text(14152, Science rests upon inductive reasoning (as opposed to deductive reasoning) but unfortunately the term carries different meanings in science and mathematics. ).
att(14152, 12779).

arg(13098).
text(13098, I think you are presenting induction in a very dubious way. One that is a misgiving of what we normally use it for. If we have literally 0 disconfirming cases in all of the observations throughout history, that can be meaningfully reproduced, then we say we have a scientifically relevant hypothesis.).
att(13098, 13083).

arg(12597).
text(12597, A scientific hypothesis is a testable "proposed explanation" for a phenomenon.
